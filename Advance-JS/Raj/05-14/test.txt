key word to decler variable

var 
let 
const


let  variable name  = value

let x = 20


let --> keyword
x --> variable name
= --> assignment operator
20 --> value



variable naming rule 

1. can't use  number 
like  let 12 = 12 --> give error

2. can't start with number
like let 1stName = 12 --> give error

3. can't use special charactor
like let @Name = ---> give error 



console.log(variable name/value)
let x = 100
console.log(x) ==> 100


console.log(x,"test") ==> 100 test
